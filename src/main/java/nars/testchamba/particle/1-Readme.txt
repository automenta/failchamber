This is a 2d particle system I programmed in Java using only the standard java libraries.

Overview:

Particles, Blocks, Collision detection, Texture mapping, Normal mapping, Gravity wells.

Controls:

  left click: create a new gravity well at mouse's location
  right click: delete the block at the mouse's location (block adding is disabled atm)
  left drag: pull particles
  right drag: create particles
  x : clear the screen
  p : clear all gravity wells
  esc: pause
